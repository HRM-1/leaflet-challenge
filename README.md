# leaflet-challenge

In this challenge, we retrieved data from a website specializing in earthquake locations (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). We specifically chose the dataset encompassing all earthquakes that occurred in the past 7 days with a magnitude exceeding 2.5. The map visually represents these locations and offers detailed information about each seismic event.
